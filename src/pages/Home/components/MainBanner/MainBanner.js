          I'm DÃ©bora, a newcomer to the world of coding! The power that technology has to transform
          people's lives was one of the main reasons that made me choose it. In 2020 I found Trybe,
          a school of the future that is leveraging my knowledge in this area and training me with
          the most sought skills by the market. I'm passionate about photography, gastronomy, and
          technology!
